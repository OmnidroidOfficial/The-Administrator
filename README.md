Experimenting with this puzzle I sometimes make such experimental adjustments that it requires serious time consuming rebuilds. 
Not to sound hubretarean or anything but things are getting more into the direction of where things should be going so to save time in case I need to do rebuilds again
I'm placing code here. Also fun for those who are into puzzling with making code more efficient. 

GitHub repositories are always so neatly organized. Once I've solved my puzzle reminder-to-self I organize this. 

"Save the Numbers" demo experiment of demo is available here: https://regentesse.info/savethenumbers/play.html .
